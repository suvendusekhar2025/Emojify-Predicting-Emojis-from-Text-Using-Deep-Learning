# Emojify-Predicting-Emojis-from-Text-Using-Deep-Learning

📝 Project Description:
Emojify is a deep learning–based Natural Language Processing (NLP) project designed to automatically predict the most contextually appropriate emoji for any given input sentence. As emojis have become an integral part of digital communication, this project bridges the gap between raw text and emotional context by enabling machines to infer sentiment and intention from language.

The core objective is to develop a model that learns semantic patterns in language and maps them to a set of predefined emoji classes, such as 😊 (happy), 😢 (sad), ❤️ (love), or 😠 (angry). The system takes unseen sentences as input and outputs the emoji that best reflects the sentence’s emotional tone.

🧠 Methodology:
Data Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed labeled sentence–emoji pairs. Text was tokenized, converted to indices, and padded to a uniform length.

Model Architecture:
Developed a deep learning model using Keras and TensorFlow, incorporating layers such as:

Embedding Layer: To convert words into dense vector representations.

Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM/GRU): To capture the sequence and context of words in a sentence.

Dense Output Layer with Softmax: To classify the input into one of several emoji categories.

Inference Pipeline: Enabled emoji prediction on completely new, unseen sentences using a trained model.

Visualization: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze class distribution and prediction confidence.

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Python, TensorFlow/Keras – model building and training

NumPy, Pandas – data handling and manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – visualization

Jupyter Notebook – interactive development and experimentation

🎯 Outcome:
The final model was able to accurately interpret the sentiment of various test sentences and output relevant emojis, demonstrating its ability to understand emotional tone and linguistic context. For example:

"I love this movie!" → ❤️

"I'm feeling really sad today." → 😢

"You are amazing!" → 😊
